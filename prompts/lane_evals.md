Implement verification/evaluation harness.

Must have:
- A unified “verify” command that runs:
  - formatting/lint
  - typecheck (TS)
  - unit tests (TS + Python)
  - e2e (Playwright) skeleton + at least one smoke test
- Output results as machine-readable JSON and also human-readable summary.
- Add docs on how to add new evals.
