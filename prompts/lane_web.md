Implement the Factory WebUI in Next.js.

Must have:
- Page that lists runs (poll or SSE via backend)
- Run detail page with real-time event stream, auto-scroll, filters by agent/lane
- Buttons: stop run, view artifacts (logs), open code diff link placeholder
- “Multi-product”: allow selecting among multiple runs.

Use minimal UI kit (shadcn ok, or plain tailwind). Commit changes.
